## 🔐 Authentication System

### Overview
The application uses a **client-side authentication system** where users provide their own API credentials:

- **Auth Token**: Bearer token for API authorization
- **Device Key**: Device-specific identifier for API access
- **Local Storage**: Credentials stored securely in browser localStorage
- **No Server Storage**: Credentials never transmitted to or stored on our servers

### How It Works

1. **First-Time Setup**:
   - Users enter their Auth Token and Device Key
   - Credentials are validated against the Bangladesh Railway API
   - Stored locally in the browser for convenience

2. **Credential Management**:
   - Automatic credential injection in form submissions
   - Validation before each API request
   - Clear error messages for expired or invalid credentials
   - Easy deletion and re-entry of credentials

3. **Security Features**:
   - HTTPS-only transmission
   - Browser-local storage only
   - No server-side credential persistence
   - User-controlled credential lifecycle

### Getting Your Credentials

Users need to obtain their own Auth Token and Device Key from authorized sources. The application provides an instruction image to guide users through the process.

**Important Notes**:
- Keep your credentials secure and private
- Do not share credentials with others
- Clear browser data on shared/public devices
- Credentials are user's responsibility

## 🧠 Core Logic

### 🚂 Report Generation System

The heart of the application lies in `reportGenerator.py`, which implements:

```python
def generate_report(train_data: dict, train_name: str, report_type: str = "comprehensive") -> str
```

**Process Flow:**
1. **Train Data Fetching**: Gets complete train information from API
2. **PDF Document Creation**: Uses ReportLab for professional formatting
3. **Content Structuring**: Organizes data into tables and sections
4. **File Management**: Handles PDF storage and cleanup

### 🔄 Train Search Algorithm

Intelligent train discovery system:

#### 1. Station-to-Station Search
```python
# Finds all trains between two stations
def search_trains_between_stations(origin: str, destination: str) -> list
```

#### 2. Route Analysis
```python
# Analyzes train routes for station coverage
def analyze_train_routes(train_list: list, origin: str, destination: str) -> dict
```

#### 3. Schedule Processing
```python
# Processes train schedules and timing information
def process_train_schedules(train_data: dict) -> dict
```

### 📊 Data Processing

Supports comprehensive train information:
- **Train Details** (Name, Number, Type)
- **Route Information** (Stations, Distances, Timing)
- **Schedule Data** (Departure/Arrival Times)
- **Class Information** (Available seat types)
- **Fare Structure** (Pricing by class and route)

---

## 📄 Report Generation

### PDF Creation with ReportLab
```python
from reportlab.platypus import SimpleDocTemplate, Paragraph, Table, TableStyle
from reportlab.lib.styles import getSampleStyleSheet
from reportlab.lib import colors
```

### Report Structure
- **Header Section**: Train name, number, and basic information
- **Route Table**: Complete station list with distances and timing
- **Schedule Information**: Departure and arrival times
- **Class Details**: Available seat types and configurations
- **Additional Information**: Notes, exceptions, and service details

### PDF Features
- **Professional Formatting**: Clean, readable layout
- **Table Styling**: Color-coded headers and alternating row colors
- **Custom Fonts**: Embedded fonts for consistent appearance
- **Page Management**: Automatic page breaks and headers
- **File Optimization**: Compressed PDFs for faster download

### File Management
```python
# Automatic cleanup of old PDF files
def cleanup_old_pdfs(max_age_hours: int = 24):
    # Removes PDFs older than specified time
```

---

## 🎨 Frontend Features

### 1. Advanced Train Selection
- **Autocomplete Dropdown**: 120+ trains with fuzzy search
- **Model Extraction**: Automatically extracts train numbers from names
- **Validation**: Ensures valid train selection before submission
- **Train Search by Route**: Find trains between specific stations

### 2. Report Interface
- **Progress Tracking**: Real-time status updates during report generation
- **Download Management**: Direct PDF download with file management
- **Preview Options**: Quick view of report contents before download

### 3. Train Search Feature
- **Station Autocomplete**: Smart dropdown with station name suggestions
- **Bidirectional Search**: Swap origin/destination with single click
- **Live Train Discovery**: Real-time API calls to find available trains
- **Results Display**: Formatted train list with route information

### 4. Mobile Optimization
- **Responsive Design**: Optimized for all screen sizes
- **Touch-friendly Controls**: Large tap targets for mobile interaction
- **Fast Loading**: Optimized assets and efficient API calls

### 5. User Interface
```javascript
// Dynamic form validation
function validateTrainSelection() {
    // Ensures proper train selection before report generation
}

// Report generation progress
function updateProgressStatus(status) {
    // Real-time updates during PDF creation
}
```

---

## ⏳ Queue Management

### Advanced Request Queue (`request_queue.py`)

**Features:**
- **Concurrent Limiting**: Configurable max concurrent requests
- **Cooldown Periods**: Prevents API flooding
- **Request Prioritization**: FIFO with abandonment detection
- **Health Monitoring**: Tracks processing times and success rates
- **Auto-cleanup**: Removes stale requests and results

**Configuration:**
```json
{
    "queue_max_concurrent": 1,
    "queue_cooldown_period": 3,
    "queue_batch_cleanup_threshold": 10,
    "queue_cleanup_interval": 30,
    "queue_heartbeat_timeout": 60
}
```

**Process Flow:**
1. Request submitted → Added to queue
2. Queue position displayed to user
3. Request processed when slot available
4. Results cached and delivered
5. Automatic cleanup of completed requests

---
